PyTorch implementation for paper [Learning to Discriminate While Contrasting: Combating False Negative Pairs with Coupled Contrastive Learning for Incomplete Multi-View Clustering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11095348).

# Datasets
- The Scene-15 dataset is placed in "datasets" folder. Another datasets could be found in paper [SURE](https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2022-TPAMI-SURE).
- Particularly, thanks to the valuable work [SURE](https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2022-TPAMI-SURE) for providing these datasets.

# Usage
```
python run.py
```
